# Getting a UCLA Logon ID.

1. So the first thing you should do if you don't have a UCLA Logon ID is to get one. Point your browser at: [https://accounts.iam.ucla.edu](https://accounts.iam.ucla.edu). 

Click `"CREATE A UCLA LOGON ID"` button. Check `"I agree to the Terms of Service."` box.  Select either: `"I HAVE A 9 DIGIT UCLA ID NUMBER (UID)"`or`"DO NOT HAVE A 9 DIGIT UCLA ID NUMBER (UID)"`

```text
IAM recommends: If you are a student, alumnus, faculty, staff, or contractor, please create a UCLA Logon with your 9 Digit UCLA ID Number (UID) to ensure access to university resources.

You may qualify for the "I HAVE..." category but even if there is some problem with it, the "I DO NOT HAVE..." button will work to create a UCLA Logon ID that Grid Identity Manager will accept.

Continue filling out the information required on the form.

UCLA Logon ID is not a service of our IDRE Research Technology Group. As their web page says, "Contact Bruin OnLine, email us at consult@ucla.edu, or give us a call at 310-267-HELP (4357)."
